The No Secret Rulers Act ensures that no one can silently assume the powers of government behind closed doors. It creates criminal penalties for anyone who acts in the name of an incapacitated official without lawful delegation, and it mandates timely reporting when public leaders are unable to perform their duties. By closing dangerous loopholes and treating cover-ups as criminal conspiracies—especially when used for personal or political gain—this law defends constitutional integrity and makes clear that in a democracy, power cannot be borrowed in secret.
