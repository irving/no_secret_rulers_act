**Criminalizing the Concealment and Exploitation of Official Incapacity**

In a representative democracy, elected and appointed officials are entrusted with power not as individuals alone, but as stewards of the public interest. When they become incapacitated — whether physically, mentally, or cognitively — there is a sacred obligation to ensure that their duties are either formally transferred or responsibly curtailed. Any concealment of such incapacity, or the assumption of their powers without lawful authority, constitutes a betrayal not only of the official's office but of the public itself. It is time to codify this principle into law.

### **A History of Quiet Substitution**

This is not a new problem. In 1919, after President Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke, his wife Edith Wilson effectively managed the presidency for the remainder of his term. Though she claimed only to act as a “steward,” she controlled access to the president, screened communications, and influenced decisions. There was no constitutional mechanism at the time for transferring power, and the public was never fully informed of Wilson’s incapacity.

More than a century later, the problem remains unresolved. In 2024, Representative Kay Granger of Texas — at one time, chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee — moved into a senior living facility amid reports of cognitive decline. Her staff made no announcement. She missed numerous votes. Constituents, colleagues, and the broader public were left uninformed about her diminshed capacity to fulfill her responsibilities. Although there is no confirmed evidence that her staff took formal action on her behalf, the opportunity for abuse was present, unchecked, and unaddressed.

Today, the nation confronts troubling reports concerning President Joe Biden’s cognitive fitness. While some allegations may be politically motivated, others raise genuine concerns. Reports suggest that certain decisions or official acts — such as pardons — may have been executed in his name without his direct involvement. If such claims are true, they represent not only a constitutional crisis but a usurpation of presidential power. Yet because existing laws fail to directly address this kind of unauthorized substitution, accountability is vague at best.

### **A Bipartisan Problem That Demands a Nonpartisan Solution**

Discussions of incapacity in office too often disintegrate into partisan rancor. Supporters of a compromised official may minimize or dismiss concerns, while opponents are accused of exaggeration or bad faith. This political noise obscures the real issue: whether anyone—regardless of party—should be allowed to conceal an official’s inability to serve while quietly exercising their authority in the background.

This is not about partisanship. It is about transparency, legality, and the rule of law. The public has a right to know when its leaders are no longer able to serve. There must be mechanisms not only for transferring power but for punishing those who deliberately exploit the absence or incapacity of an official to pursue a personal or political agenda.

### **The Need for New Legislation**

To prevent future abuses, Congress should pass legislation that explicitly criminalizes:

1. **Knowingly concealing the physical or cognitive incapacity of an elected or appointed federal official.**

2. **Exercising, directing, or assuming the powers of that office without lawful authorization while aware of the official's incapacity.**

3. **Failing to notify designated oversight authorities (such as congressional leadership, the vice president, or the relevant inspector general) when credible evidence of incapacity arises within a federal office.**

Such legislation should include robust whistleblower protections and impose serious penalties — up to and including imprisonment — for individuals who knowingly violate these provisions. Exceptions can be made for family members or medical professionals acting under patient privacy obligations, but not for staff, appointees, or advisors wielding or diverting official power.

### **Conclusion**

When public officials become incapacitated, the system must not depend on informal arrangements, quiet coverups, or partisan calculations. The stakes are too high. As history and recent events have shown, the risk is real and bipartisan. If the law does not clearly prohibit and punish the exploitation of incapacitated officials, the public remains vulnerable to government by proxy — an invisible and unaccountable form of power.

The time has come to end the era of shadow governance. The United States must establish, in law, that the concealment or exploitation of official incapacity is not merely unethical—it is criminal.
