**Subject:** Support the No Secret Rulers Act

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

Whoever we elect should be the one doing the job. If they can’t serve, the public deserves to know—and no one else should be running things in secret.

The No Secret Rulers Act would make sure incapacity is reported quickly, power is transferred legally, and those who hide the truth are held accountable. This is common sense, not partisan politics.

Please [introduce / co-sponsor / vote for] the NSRA and keep our government transparent and accountable.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[City, State]
