# **The No Secret Rulers Act (NSRA) – Write Your Rep Kit**

## **What’s the NSRA?**

The No Secret Rulers Act is a common-sense safeguard for American democracy. Its core idea is simple:

> Whoever we elect is the one who should serve.
> If they can’t serve, the public should know, and power should be transferred legally and transparently.

This is **not** a partisan issue—it’s about keeping government accountable to the people. The NSRA would:

* Require prompt reporting when an official is incapacitated or missing.
* Prohibit anyone from exercising the powers of an office without legal authority.
* Establish penalties for concealing incapacity or unlawfully acting in an official’s stead.
* Provide procedures for reversing unauthorized actions where appropriate.

* Follow up in 2–3 weeks if you haven’t received a reply.
