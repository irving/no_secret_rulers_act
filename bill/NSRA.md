# **No Secret Rulers Act (NSRA)**

---

## **Preamble**

In affirmation of the bipartisan and nonpartisan values that undergird our constitutional system,

Whereas the Constitution of the United States vests the powers of government in the hands of elected and duly appointed officials, accountable to the people and constrained by law;

Whereas the legitimacy of public authority derives not from secrecy or convenience, but from lawful processes of election, appointment, and transparent delegation;

Whereas history has shown that during periods of illness, incapacitation, or cognitive decline, the powers of office have, on occasion, been exercised by unelected individuals acting without legal authority or public disclosure;

Whereas such exercises of power—however well-intentioned—undermine the foundational principle that government must operate with the consent of the governed;

Whereas no privilege of confidentiality, secrecy, or internal deliberation may be used to conceal the fact that public power is being wielded by those who have not been authorized by law or by the people;

Whereas the public has a right to know whether those who appear to govern in their name are, in fact, capable of doing so, and whether constitutional processes for transfer or delegation of authority have been followed;

Therefore, be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that this Act may be cited as the **No Secret Rulers Act**, and that it shall establish clear procedures, safeguards, and penalties to ensure that no individual shall exercise the powers of government in secret, in the name of another, or outside lawful delegation, especially when an official has become incapacitated, unavailable, or otherwise unable to perform the duties of office.
