# The No Secret Rulers Act

## Overview

**The No Secret Rulers Act (NSRA)** is a proposed piece of legislation designed to prevent unelected or unauthorized individuals from wielding executive or legislative authority in the name of incapacitated public officials. Its goal is to ensure transparency, accountability, and timely disclosure when an official is unable to fulfill the duties of their office due to illness, absence, or cognitive decline.

This repository contains the text of the proposed legislation as well as supporting materials intended to assist with public education, press outreach, and legislative advocacy.

## Purpose

The No Secret Rulers Act addresses a critical gap in democratic governance: the lack of legal safeguards against undisclosed power transfers within elected offices. By making it a legal requirement to disclose incapacitation and prohibiting unauthorized decision-making, this act aims to:

- Reinforce the public’s right to know who is making official decisions.
- Prevent informal or covert rule by unelected proxies.
- Establish clear reporting and disclosure mechanisms.
- Create penalties for covering up incapacitation or usurping authority.
