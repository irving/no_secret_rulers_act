# NSRA FAQ

## What is the No Secret Rulers Act?

- It's a proposed law to prevent unelected individuals from secretly exercising the powers of  government office without legitimate authority. If a government official such as a cabinet member or a senator had an illness that prevented them from doing their job, it would be a serious felony for someone else to try to do it for them. 
- You can find the (current) text of the law here: https://github.com/irving/no_secret_rulers_act/tree/main/bill
- The text was written by ChatGPT with considerable guidance from a human _who is not a lawyer_. 
- Ideas and any other contributions from the public are welcome! 

## Why is this necessary?

- Because history shows that when a leader becomes incapacitated, others often step in without legal authority — sometimes for weeks, months, or longer. This violates democratic principles and can lead to unaccountable decision-making.
- When President Woodrow Wilson had a near-fatal stroke, his wife Edith stepped in to control access to him and to manage the flow of day-to-day work. She later claimed she didn't make any decisions for the president, she just asked him what he wanted, then saw to it that it was carried out. It is almost certain that she lied. For about 18 months, it was really Edith who was running the government.
- This is not how a democratic republic is supposed to work!
- Currently, lots of people are worried that when Joe Biden was president, someone else was actually running things. It's going to take years for details on that to come out. Even if it somehow turns out all the critics were wrong about Biden, this has happened before! Let's try to keep it from happening again.

## What happens if someone breaks this law?

- They could face investigation, criminal penalties, and have their actions legally reversed unless those actions were urgently necessary and later properly ratified.
- We're not trying to get in the way of the proper function of government. We're trying to stop people from stealing power that isn't rightfully theirs!
- Just to be clear, though, you can't break a law that didn't exist at the time you did what it forbids. In other words, even if all the worst allegations about the Biden administration (or even the Wilson administration) turn out to be true, this law could not apply. This is a law for the future of the republic, not a tool for getting revenge for the past.

## HOW CAN I HELP?

- __Help improve the draft__
  - If you're a lawyer or legislative aid familiar with how laws are written, please take a look at the draft and let us know how to make it stronger, clearer and more enforceable. 
- If you are a US senator or member of the House of Representatives you can introduce the bill officially. Right now, it's just a draft. Propose it - and talk to your colleagues about why we need it.
- __Spread the word!!__
  - Share the newsletter far and wide.
  - Follow @NoSecretRulers on X and repost! (I'm terrible at social media myself, so every bit helps.)
  - Use the tag #NoSecretRulers everywhere!
