**Title:** *Proposed Law Aims to End Government-by-Proxy in the Shadows*

WASHINGTON, D.C. — A new legislative proposal seeks to eliminate the dangerous ambiguity that arises when incapacitated officials remain in office while unelected individuals act in their place.

The **No Secret Rulers Act** (NSRA) would make it illegal to conceal transfers of public authority from the people. The law mandates transparency and criminalizes prolonged deception.

> “This isn’t a partisan issue—it’s a democratic one,” said David Vandervort, editor of the draft legislation. “We need to know who is making decisions on our behalf.”

The NSRA is a response to historical cases like President Wilson’s stroke in 1919 and more recent concerns around unacknowledged staff rule in Congress.
