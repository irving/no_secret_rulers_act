### What is the No Secret Rulers Act (NSRA)?

The NSRA is proposed legislation that ensures the public is always informed about **who is exercising public authority**. If an elected or appointed official becomes incapacitated and someone else takes over duties—formally or informally—the public has a right to know. Democracy demands **transparency and accountability**.

### Why It Matters Now

From the twilight presidency of Woodrow Wilson to modern examples of cognitive decline in office, we’ve seen the **quiet transfer of power** to unelected, unaccountable actors. This law would make the risk of that **much** higher.

### What It Does

- Requires timely reporting of incapacitation
- Prohibits secret delegation of power
- Criminalizes prolonged deception about official status
- Protects whistleblowers
